# Writing even better FHE programs
In this section, we're going to cover a few techniques to get the most out of your FHE applications. 

Specifically, we'll look at:
* Manually changing the plaintext modulus to better suit your data and computation
* Manually changing the noise margin to allow for more efficient computations
* Manually pruning unused public keys for space savings
