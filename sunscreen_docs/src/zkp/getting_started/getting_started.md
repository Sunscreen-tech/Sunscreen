# Getting started
This chapter walks through installation. We also provide an overview of Sunscreen's ZKP compiler through a simple example of proving set inclusion (i.e. our number is on a given list of numbers without revealing which one it is).

If you'd like to try out our ZKP compiler before installing it, check out our [playground](https://playground.sunscreen.tech/).
